      In the multiplication table, the user can tap on one number in each axis and then the result
                            will be highlighted in
                            color.
                            In addition, when the user hovers over any number, a bubble will appear that will show the
                            calculation for the result.
                            This app can be very effective for children who have difficulty with this.
                            In addition, the application has an option to invert colors and this will contribute to
                            accessibility for people with
                            disabilities.
